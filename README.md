This project is about Walkability vs. Subjective Well-Being.

# Dataset
walkability_dataset.csv could be download at [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1of24j3GUa7OwwX0D-3TQq_bAK4UJ0LeQ/view?usp=sharing)

## Preprocessing
Cleaned dataset dubbed 'Happiness_index_merged.csv' will not result from proper preprocessing file 'merge_and_process.py' when passing the happiness dataset and walkabality dataset. This is because there are inconsistencies in naming schemies of CBSA codes so roughly ~50 files were manually entered from its resulting output.

# Set Up
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
